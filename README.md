# NftMetadataIndexerSDKUltra

## Description

A smart contract suite implementing a novel NFT fractionalization and dynamic royalty distribution mechanism based on a Merkle tree structure, enabling gas-efficient on-chain governance of shared ownership.

## Features

- Indexes NFT metadata across multiple EVM-compatible chains using a standardized event listener.
- Implements a configurable caching layer with Redis for improved query performance and reduced API load.
- Provides a GraphQL API endpoint for flexible and efficient querying of NFT metadata.
- Supports custom metadata schema definitions via a YAML configuration file, allowing for indexing of non-standard NFTs.
- Generates optimized SQL queries against a PostgreSQL database for efficient data retrieval.
- Utilizes a message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ or Kafka) for asynchronous metadata processing and indexing.
- Includes a rate limiting mechanism to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage of the indexing service.
- Exposes Prometheus metrics for monitoring the health and performance of the indexer, including indexing latency and error rates.
